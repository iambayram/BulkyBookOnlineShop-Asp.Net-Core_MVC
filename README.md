*In this project, I used n-tier architecture to be able to control it better. With the help of MVC structure, It was easier to have a better relationship between Models and Views. Code first approach used and migrated into MsSql Server. Some libraries like Bootstrap, Bootswatch, Toastr, Data Tables, SweetAlert2, TinyMCE were used to have a better display of the WebSite. By AspNetCore.Identity, I was able to make the Authentication and Authorization.  *
